## Day's Since Last Useless House Service was Made: 0

A simple interface for logging and displaying time since a certain event has occured, allowing for CSHer's to track how long its been since a prior event. Heavily inspired off the "Days since last..." meme format.

This project uses Golang, [Gin](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

This project ALSO uses a modified version of bootstrap 5! Check it out [here!](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/csh-material-bootstrap/tree/bootstrap-5)
